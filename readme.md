# PIPG / SO2-Project

## Problems

- Random map creation

## stages

- [x] Create threading
- [ ] create map generation
- [x] create player/enemy models
- [ ] enemy moving algorithms (teleportation and movement for enemies)
- [x] map bounding
- [ ] user interface
- [ ] Create documentation (in-game instruction)
- [x] create graphics
- [ ] music

## todo

- difficulty levels:
  - teleport only (done)
  - movement (change Vector2 in Ghost.gd randomly with delay [move_and_collide, move_and_slide])
  - teleport with movement (combine above) [change idea for selecting new teleportation location]
- music and audio effects
- souls like "you died" end screen (after this show main menu button)
